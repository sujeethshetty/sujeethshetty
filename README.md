# Hi, I'm Sujeeth 👋

## 🚀 What I'm Building

**[OpenBell.ai](https://openbell.ai)** - AI-scored real-time financial news for retail investors. Wall Street has Bloomberg. Now you have OpenBell.

Currently expanding OpenBell with a multi-agent powered financial research platform featuring portfolio visualization and backtesting capabilities - think having a hedge fund analyst that speaks plain English.

**🤖 AI Agent Collaboration** - Teaching my personal agent [Aira](https://github.com/aira-bot) to use Claude Code and autonomously push PRs while I handle the critical thinking and architectural decisions. She primarily manages the [tezra-io](https://github.com/tezra-io) organization.

**🦀 ZeroClaw & Voice-OS** - Working with Aira on developing voice-os and enhancing ZeroClaw (a Rust-based virtual assistant) to support agent swarm capabilities for distributed AI workflows.

## 📦 Personal AI Labs

- **[sixteen-dev](https://github.com/sixteen-dev)** - open source projects and experiments
- **[tezra-io](https://github.com/tezra-io)** - AI agent infrastructure and tooling (managed by Aira)

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Multi-agent systems & agentic workflows
- Fintech infrastructure & real-time financial data processing
- Human-AI collaboration patterns for software development
- AI evals and agent performance measurement
- Data engineering with Spark, Kafka, and modern data lakehouse architectures
